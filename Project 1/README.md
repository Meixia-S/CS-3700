# 3700-Project-1
<pre>
High-level Approach:

I wanted to seperate the guessing of the word to be seperate from playing through the game. That way
seemed to make sense as both tasks are quite different. I also somewhat imaged the client class to
be the player and the Main class was the middle man that connected the player with the game (server)
and played it through.

Guessing Strategy:

I would summarize my logic as a seires of loops and checks. 
For each guess a for loop would travers the entire list of possible words. The first would be to see if we
have already guessed the word. If so break from the loops, else start traversing through the word letter by 
letter.
... incomplete...

Testing:

Due to the simplicity of the program, I mainly used print statements to check.

Challenges:

The logic of the guessing and game play was fairly easy: what I did struggle with is the makefile. 
I have never had to write one myself up until this point so this was totally new to me and took me
some time to get it right.
